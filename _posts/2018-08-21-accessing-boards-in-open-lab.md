It is quite challenging to get a specific hardware for any development and testing. When it comes to ARM64 based hardware, it will be hard to find one currently! <span style="color: #0000ff;">**But, Open Estuary has an answer to it - Open Lab for ARM64 boards! Yes, it is real!**</span>

Currently we have deployed large number of ARM64 boards in a professional data center environment. All for collaborative development, testing and research. **It is open for all users like you! **
